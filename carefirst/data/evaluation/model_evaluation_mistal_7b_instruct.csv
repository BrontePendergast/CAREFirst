To prevent hypothermia, it's recommended to wear appropriate clothing, including hats and tightly woven fibers, avoid cotton, wear layers, keep clothing dry, consume high-energy foods and warm, high-calorie drinks, avoid alcohol, take frequent breaks from the cold, increase activity level, add insulation, and get out of the cold if shivering occurs.

Symptoms of hypothermia can range from shivering and normal mental status to decreased physical function, confusion, and unresponsiveness. Severe hypothermia can lead to a stopped shivering response, unresponsiveness, and slowed or stopped breathing.

If you suspect someone has hypothermia, it's important to call for medical help and take steps to warm them up gradually. This can include moving them to a warmer environment, using methods like immersion in cool water, pouring cool water on their clothing, or applying ice or cold packs to their armpits and chest. If the person is responsive and able to swallow, they can be given cool electrolyte-replacement beverages.",155,151,0.6723856,0.07228915469298888,0.0,0.06024096192190455,0

It can lead to impaired physical and mental functioning, and if left untreated, it can result in serious health complications or even death.

People with smaller body types, lower overall body weights, and lower body-fat content are more susceptible to hypothermia. It can occur at any time of the year, but young children and the elderly are particularly at risk.

Common causes of hypothermia include sweating while outdoors in cold weather, cold, wet, windy conditions, cold-water immersion, dehydration, and taking medications to eliminate water from the body.

To prevent hypothermia, it's recommended to wear appropriate clothing, including hats and tightly woven fibers, avoid cotton, wear clothing in layers, keep clothing dry, consume high-energy foods and warm, high-calorie drinks, avoid alcohol, take frequent breaks from the cold, and increase activity level or add insulation or a heat source when necessary.

Symptoms of hypothermia can range from shivering and normal mental status to decreased physical function, difficulty taking care of oneself, weak and intermittent shivering, confusion or unusual behavior, impaired judgment, and unresponsiveness. In severe cases, shivering may stop, breathing may slow down or stop, and the body may feel stiff with no pulse.

If you suspect someone has hypothermia, it's important to call for medical help if they are vomiting, have an altered level of responsiveness, or are unable to drink fluids. In the meantime, reduce heat exposure, remove tight clothing, pour cool water on the person, apply ice or cold packs, and have them slowly sip a cool electrolyte-replacement beverage if they are responsive and able to swallow.",151,151,0.8638843,0.1651376130123727,0.059999998698000025,0.1651376130123727,1

87,How does angina differ from a heart attack?,"The signs and symptoms of angina are similar to a heart attack, but the pain in angina is usually triggered by physical activity or stress, goes away if the person rests, and is often relieved by medication like nitroglycerin.","Angina and heart attacks are related conditions that involve the heart and its blood supply, but they are not the same thing.

Angina is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen-rich blood. This can be due to the heart needing more oxygen than it's receiving, often because the arteries are narrowed by cardiovascular disease. Angina is usually triggered by physical activity or emotional stress, and it goes away with rest or medication. The pain is described as a squeezing, suffocating, or burning feeling in the chest.

A heart attack, on the other hand, is a more serious condition where the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. This can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. Heart attacks can cause severe chest pain, but they can also cause other symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and pain or discomfort in the arm or jaw. Unlike angina, the pain of a heart attack does not go away with rest or medication, and it requires immediate medical attention.

The key difference is that angina is a symptom of an underlying heart condition, while a heart attack is a specific event where part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies due to lack of blood flow. Angina can be a warning sign of an impending heart attack, but not all angina leads to a heart attack.

It's important to note that because the symptoms of angina and a heart attack can be similar, it's not possible for a First Aider to distinguish between the two. Therefore, if you suspect someone is having a heart attack, you should always call emergency services (EMS/9-1-1) immediately.",57,57,0.77144736,0.29347825785680526,0.10380622608972599,0.2717391274220227,1

If you or someone else has come into contact with the sap and it's on the eyes, face, or groin, or if the person is having trouble breathing, call EMS/9-1-1 immediately.

If the sap has come into contact with the skin but is not on sensitive areas, protect the area from sunlight. Rinse the affected area thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes if the sap has gotten into the eyes. Encourage the person to seek medical attention.

If a reaction occurs, the affected area may be sensitive to sunlight for months or even years. Protect the area by keeping it covered, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen.

If you've come into contact with the sap but haven't been exposed to sunlight yet, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.
