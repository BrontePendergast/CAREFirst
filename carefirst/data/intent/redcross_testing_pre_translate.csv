347,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,59,What precautions can reduce the likelihood of an injury that causes life-threatening bleeding?,"The following precautions may reduce the likelihood of an injury that causes life-threatening bleeding: Be familiar with your surroundings, keep all sharp objects in a safe place, get proper training on machinery, follow safety procedures when operating equipment, wear and use appropriate safety equipment, only use equipment for its intended purpose, and stay alert when operating equipment."
348,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,59,What are the signs and symptoms of life-threatening external bleeding?,"The signs and symptoms of life-threatening external bleeding include: blood spurting or flowing freely from a wound, blood that fails to clot after taking measures to control bleeding, and large amounts of blood loss."
349,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,59,What should you do if you encounter life-threatening external bleeding?,"If you encounter life-threatening external bleeding, you should call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. Expose the wound, apply firm and direct pressure to the wound, apply a dressing and bandage, and secure them in place. Reassess the wound to see if the pressure has stopped the bleeding. If not, consider using a tourniquet if the wound is on a limb."
350,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,60,What is a tourniquet?,"A tourniquet is a tight band placed around an extremity (e.g., an arm or leg) to constrict blood vessels and stop life-threatening bleeding."
351,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,60,When should a tourniquet be applied?,"A tourniquet should be applied in situations where there is life-threatening external bleeding that cannot be controlled using direct pressure, when it is impossible to apply direct pressure due to physical location (e.g., trapped in a confined space), or when you need to move the person and cannot maintain direct pressure."
352,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,60,How should a tourniquet be applied?,"To apply a tourniquet, follow these steps:
1. Apply the tourniquet 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in.) above the injury, avoiding joints.
2. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops.
3. Secure the tourniquet in place.
4. Document the time the tourniquet was tightened."

Help the injured person rest in the most comfortable position and provide continual care while waiting for EMS personnel."
359,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What is CPR?,CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a skill used when a person is in cardiac arrest. CPR involves giving sets of 30 chest compressions followed by sets of 2 rescue breaths to keep oxygenated blood moving to the brain and other vital organs until advanced medical help arrives.
360,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What happens during cardiac arrest?,"Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. The electrical impulses in the heart become abnormal and chaotic, causing the heart to lose the ability to beat rhythmically or to stop beating altogether."
361,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What is sudden cardiac arrest?,"Sudden cardiac arrest is when cardiac arrest happens suddenly and without any warning signs. People with a history of cardiovascular disease or a congenital heart disorder are at higher risk for sudden cardiac arrest. However, it can also happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or risk factors."
362,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What is clinical death?,"Clinical death occurs when breathing stops and the heart stops beating. A person without a heartbeat is clinically dead. However, clinical death is reversible with immediate care and intervention before permanent brain damage occurs."
363,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What is biological death?,"Biological death occurs when the brain becomes irreversibly damaged, usually after about 8 to 10 minutes without oxygen. This is also known as 'brain death'."
364,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,63,What is the link between the respiratory and circulatory systems?,"The respiratory and circulatory systems are closely linked. After breathing stops, it is not long before the heart stops as well. This is especially true in children, as pediatric cardiac arrests are often the result of airway or breathing emergencies."
365,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What are the signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest?,"When a person experiences cardiac arrest, signs and symptoms may include the following: •The person suddenly collapses. •The person is unresponsive and not breathing, or is unresponsive with agonal breaths."
366,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What are the common causes of cardiac arrest?,"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. Other common causes include drowning, severe blood loss, suffocation or complete choking, electrocution, drug overdose, severe chest injuries, commotio cordis, and other heart diseases and abnormalities."
367,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What increases the risk of cardiac arrest?,"Cardiovascular disease and certain congenital heart conditions can increase the risk of cardiac arrest. Breathing emergencies such as choking or drowning can also lead to cardiac arrest. Severe trauma, electrical shocks, and drug overdoses are other potential causes of cardiac arrest."
368,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What are the common causes of cardiac arrest in children and babies?,"The most common causes of cardiac arrest in children and babies are breathing emergencies, congenital heart disorders, and trauma."
369,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What should be the top priority when someone experiences cardiac arrest?,"Starting CPR is the top priority when someone experiences cardiac arrest. Other injuries or conditions, such as head, neck, or spinal injuries, are lower priority compared to starting CPR and getting an AED."
370,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,What should you do if someone experiences cardiac arrest?,"If someone experiences cardiac arrest, you should call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. If you are alone with an adult, call EMS/9-1-1 yourself, get an AED, and then return to care for the person."
371,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,64,How does the delay in CPR and use of an AED affect the person's chance of survival?,"For each minute that CPR and use of an AED are delayed, the person's chance of survival is reduced by about 10%."

417,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,68,What is compression-only CPR?,Compression-only CPR uses chest compressions (without rescue breaths) to pump the heart and circulate oxygen that is already in the person’s body. It is acceptable if you are unwilling or unable to give rescue breaths for any reason.
418,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,68,What should you do if the chest does not rise after the first breath?,"After the 30 chest compressions, look in the person’s mouth. If you see an object, carefully remove it by grasping the lower jaw and tongue (if possible) while opening the mouth, and using one finger to sweep behind the object to lift it out."
419,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,68,When is compression-only CPR recommended?,"Compression-only CPR is recommended as a minimum for any person in cardiac arrest. However, traditional CPR with rescue breaths is recommended for children, babies, or any person who entered cardiac arrest due to a respiratory problem."
420,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,69,What is the recommended compression depth for an adult during CPR?,"When providing CPR to an adult, you should perform compressions with a depth of at least 5 cm (about 2 in.), but avoid excessive depths greater than 6 cm (about 2.5 in.)."
421,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,69,How should chest compressions be performed on a child or baby during CPR?,"When providing CPR to a child or baby, compressions should be performed on the lower half of the sternum and the chest should be depressed to at least 1/3 of its depth. Ideally, compressions should be at the upper limit of 1/2 of the front-to-back depth."
422,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,69,What is the recommended compression rate for chest compressions during CPR?,Chest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute.
423,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,69,Why is chest recoil important during CPR?,Chest recoil is important during CPR because it allows the coronary arteries of the heart to be filled with blood and the heart muscle to receive oxygen. Leaning on the person's chest between compressions can prevent sufficient blood flow to the coronary arteries and lead to heart death.
424,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,Is upper-body strength required for performing CPR compressions?,"No, the power for compressions comes from the weight of your upper body, not from your arm muscles."
425,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,What can cause your arms and shoulders to tire quickly during CPR compressions?,Incorrect technique or body position can cause your arms and shoulders to tire quickly during CPR compressions.
426,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,Why should interruptions to chest compressions be minimized during CPR?,Interruptions decrease the total number of compressions given and the amount of blood that is circulated.
427,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,When should interruptions to chest compressions be limited to?,"Interruptions should be limited to critical interventions, such as applying AED pads, allowing the AED to analyze or administer a shock, and clearing the airway."
428,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,Should you reposition your hands after every compression during CPR?,"No, there is no need to reposition your hands after every compression."
429,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,What should be done when performing CPR for a pregnant woman?,Raising her right hip 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in.) will help blood return to the heart.
430,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,What should be done if a pregnant woman needs a soft object placed under her hip during CPR?,"If a bystander is available, ask them to find a soft object. Do not interrupt or delay starting CPR to find an object yourself."
431,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,What can happen if air is pushed into the person's stomach instead of their lungs during rescue breaths?,"Air in the stomach can make someone vomit, and if they vomit, the stomach contents may get into the lungs, which is called aspiration."
432,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,How should rescue breaths be given to prevent aspiration?,Rescue breaths should be given only until the chest starts to rise.
433,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,70,What should be done if a person vomits while CPR is being performed?,"Turn the person onto their side, quickly wipe their mouth clean, and then reposition them on their back and continue with CPR."

449,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,What is mouth-to-nose breathing?,"Mouth-to-nose breathing is a technique used when you cannot seal your mouth over the person's mouth to give rescue breaths. It involves tilting the person's head, blocking or closing the mouth, and breathing into the person's nose."
450,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,When would you use mouth-to-nose breathing?,"Mouth-to-nose breathing is used when the person's jaw or mouth is injured, shut too tightly to open, your mouth is too small to cover their mouth, or if the person has blood coming out of their mouth."
451,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,What is mouth-to-stoma breathing?,Mouth-to-stoma breathing is a technique used for people who have had an operation to remove part of the trachea. They breathe through an opening called a stoma in the front of the neck. Rescue breaths are given into the stoma while blocking the person's mouth and nose.
452,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,What is an automated external defibrillator (AED)?,"An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a device used to correct abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-tach), which can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. It delivers an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal rhythm."
453,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,How does an AED help in sudden cardiac arrest?,"While CPR can help keep oxygenated blood moving throughout the body, an AED can correct the underlying problem for some people who go into sudden cardiac arrest. It can restore a normal heart rhythm and prevent brain damage and death."
454,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,72,What are ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)?,"Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) is a condition where the heart muscle quivers weakly instead of contracting strongly. Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) is a condition where the heart muscle contracts too rapidly. Both of these rhythms impair the heart's ability to pump and circulate blood, and both are life-threatening."
455,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,What can an AED do to correct V-fib and V-tach rhythms?,An AED can deliver an electrical shock to disrupt the heart's electrical activity and allow it to develop an effective rhythm on its own.
456,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,What should be done immediately along with using an AED?,CPR should be started immediately along with using an AED.
457,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,What should you know if your place of employment has an AED on site?,"You should know the location of the AED, how to operate it, and the procedures around it, such as reporting its use or replacing its batteries."

460,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,What happens if the person's heart has no electrical activity?,"If the person's heart has no electrical activity, defibrillation won't help."
461,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,How does the chance of survival change for each minute of waiting for defibrillation?,"For each minute of waiting for defibrillation, the chance of survival drops between 7 and 10%."
462,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,73,What are the steps to prepare for applying the AED pads?,"The steps to prepare for applying the AED pads are:
1. Remove or cut away clothing and undergarments to expose the person's chest.
2. Move or remove any objects that could come into contact with the pads.
3. If the person's chest is wet, dry it using a towel or gauze pad.
4. Small amounts of chest hair will not interfere with pad adhesion. If the person has thick chest hair, shave the areas where the pads will be placed using the razor included with the AED prep kit."
463,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,74,How can you check if a person has an implanted pacemaker?,Look on the chest for a small scar and a lump about the size of a matchbox.

467,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,74,What size of AED pads should you use for a child?,"A child is considered to be between 1 and 8 years old. If child AED pads are unavailable, use adult pads."
468,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,75,What should you do when the AED prompts you to analyze the heart rhythm?,"Most AEDs will begin to analyze the heart rhythm automatically, but some may require you to push an 'analyze' button to start this process. No one should touch the person while the AED is analyzing the heart rhythm because this could result in a faulty reading."
469,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,75,What should you do if the AED prompts you to deliver a shock?,"If the AED prompts you to deliver a shock, you should stand clear and say 'I’m clear, you’re clear, everybody’s clear.' Ensure that no one is touching the person, then press the 'shock' button."
470,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,75,What should you do after delivering a shock or if the AED determines that no shock is necessary?,"After a shock is delivered or if the AED determines that no shock is necessary, you should immediately resume CPR, starting with compressions."

472,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,75,What should you do if you notice an obvious sign of life?,"If you notice an obvious sign of life, you should stop CPR, but leave the AED turned on and the pads in place on the person’s chest. Continue to follow the AED’s prompts."
473,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,75,What are some environmental considerations for safe and effective AED use?,"Some environmental considerations for safe and effective AED use include not using an AED around flammable or combustible materials, ensuring that the AED pads do not touch metal surfaces when the person is lying on them, removing the person from water before using the AED, and being cautious of liquids that conduct electricity."
474,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,Is it safe to use AEDs in all weather conditions?,"It is safe to use AEDs in all weather conditions, including rain and snow. However, the effectiveness of the AED can be reduced if the pads are wet. It is recommended to provide a dry environment if possible, but do not delay defibrillation to do so."
475,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,What should be done if the AED pads are wet?,"If the AED pads are wet, it is recommended to move the person into a different environment, if possible, before attempting defibrillation again."
476,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,Is it safe to use an AED on a pregnant woman?,"Yes, it is safe to use an AED on a woman who is pregnant."
477,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,What should be done if the person has a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)?,"If the person has a pacemaker or ICD, adjust the pad placement to avoid placing the AED pads directly over the device, as this can interfere with the delivery of the shock. If you are not sure whether the person has an implanted device, place the pads as you normally would."
478,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,What should be done if the person is wearing transdermal medication patches?,"If the person is wearing transdermal medication patches, such as nitroglycerin or smoking cessation patches, remove them before applying AED pads. It is recommended to wear gloves to prevent absorption of the drug through your own skin."
479,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,76,Does chest hair interfere with AED pad adhesion?,"In most cases, sparse chest hair does not interfere with AED pad adhesion. You should proceed as you normally would and attach the AED pads, pressing firmly to ensure adhesion.

Depending on the severity of the concussion, signs and symptoms can last for days, weeks, or even months."
703,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,115,What causes a concussion?,"A concussion may be caused by a blunt force to the head or jaw, an explosion, whiplash, a forceful blow to the body, or shaking (in the case of a baby)."
704,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,115,What happens to brain cells in a concussion?,"It is not fully known exactly what happens to brain cells in a concussion, but a change in the brain’s chemical function seems to be involved in the process. As a result, concussions are rarely visible in neuroimaging scans. The exact duration of this altered function is not yet known, but during the recovery period the brain is more susceptible to further injury."
705,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,115,What should you do if someone is suspected of having a concussion?,"As soon as someone is suspected of having a concussion, they should be removed from activity and seek care from a qualified medical professional.

Sleeping more or less than usual
Difficulty sleeping"
709,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,117,Why are concussions often left untreated?,"Concussions are often left untreated because the symptoms are not always recognized by the person who has been injured, and the signs are not always obvious to others. There may also be personal or external pressures to continue participating in the activity at hand instead of avoiding such aggravating factors."
710,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,117,What should a person do if they suspect they have a concussion?,"If a person suspects they have a concussion, they should stop the activity they were engaged in when the incident occurred and seek medical attention as soon as possible. It is important to follow up with a qualified healthcare provider for a full evaluation and to receive appropriate care."
711,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,117,What are some signs and symptoms of a concussion in children and babies?,"Identifying signs and symptoms of a concussion in children and babies can be more difficult. In addition to the standard signs of a concussion, children and babies may exhibit disturbed sleeping and eating patterns, excessive crying, disinterest in activities or favorite toys, and may express feeling off or not feeling right following a physical impact."
712,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,117,When should EMS/9-1-1 be called for a concussion?,"EMS/9-1-1 should be called for a concussion if the person has more severe signs and symptoms, such as repeated or projectile vomiting, loss of responsiveness, lack of physical coordination, confusion, disorientation, memory loss, changes to normal speech, seizures, vision and ocular changes, persistent dizziness or loss of balance, weakness or tingling in the arms or legs, or severe or increasing headache."
713,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,117,What are the potential consequences of failing to identify and respond to a concussion?,"While rare, permanent brain damage and death are potential consequences of failing to identify and respond to a concussion in a timely manner. Prompt recognition of a potential concussion injury, immediate removal from the activity, and appropriate follow-up care are key elements in preventing catastrophic consequences."
714,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What is Shaken Baby Syndrome?,"Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) refers to a variety of injuries that may result when a baby or a young child is violently shaken. This causes the brain to move within the skull, forcing blood vessels to stretch and tear. SBS is most associated with babies and toddlers, but can occur in children up to 5 years old."
715,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What are the consequences of Shaken Baby Syndrome?,"SBS is the most common cause of mortality in babies. It is the most frequent cause of long-term disability in babies and young children, and it can cause permanent brain damage. SBS differs from other forms of physical abuse in that it is frequently a single event and there may be no obvious sign of injury."
716,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What are the common triggers for shaking a baby?,Inconsolable crying is the most common trigger that leads a person to shake a baby. Other common triggers are feeding problems and difficulties with toilet training.
717,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What should you do if you feel like you might lose control and want to shake a child or baby?,"If you feel like you might lose control, stop!

718,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What are the signs and symptoms of a concussion?,"Signs and symptoms of a concussion include headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory problems, sensitivity to light and noise, and changes in mood or behavior."
719,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What should you do if someone exhibits concerning signs and symptoms of a concussion?,"Anyone who exhibits more concerning signs and symptoms requires immediate medical evaluation. An injury that causes a concussion may also trigger bleeding in or around the brain, leading to symptoms like extended drowsiness and confusion. This type of bleeding can be life-threatening. The person must be monitored in the immediate hours after the injury to ensure that the symptoms do not progress or worsen, as this can indicate additional brain injuries that require emergency care."
720,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,Is it safe for a person with a concussion to go to sleep?,"It is generally considered safe for a person with a concussion to go to sleep. However, the person’s healthcare provider may recommend that you wake the person periodically to make sure that his or her condition has not worsened."
721,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,What should a person do after suffering a concussion?,"It is important that the person seek medical advice from a doctor, ideally one who specializes in concussions, since signs and symptoms can escalate in the days or weeks following the injury. A person who has suffered a concussion should not participate in any physical activities until a doctor gives permission to do so. Activities that require concentration and visual stimulation should also be reduced to allow the brain the opportunity to recover from cognitive stressors. When given permission from a doctor, it is important to resume all of these activities gradually and be monitored by a medical professional."
722,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,118,Who should monitor the symptoms and behavior of a person recovering from a concussion?,"A person recovering from a concussion may not be able to effectively monitor his or her own symptoms, and may not make the best decisions about things like rest, sleep, and limiting visual stimulation. It is crucial that the person’s family members, caregivers, friends, or colleagues note any changes in his or her sleep habits or physical, cognitive, or emotional behavior, as any of these can indicate that the recovery phase has been compromised."
723,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,119,What should you do if you feel the need to hurt a baby?,"Call for help: a family member, neighbor, or local crisis line can provide emotional support and help you find a solution."

728,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What are muscles?,"Muscles are soft tissues that can contract and relax. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons and move the body when they receive signals from the brain."
729,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a joint?,A joint is formed where two or more bones are held together by ligaments that allow movement.
730,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,"What are the jobs of bones, muscles, and joints?","Bones, muscles, and joints have many jobs, including supporting the body, protecting internal organs, allowing movement, storing minerals, producing blood cells, and producing heat through movement."
731,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,"What are the four basic types of bone, muscle, and joint injuries?","The four basic types of bone, muscle, and joint injuries are dislocation, sprain, strain, and fracture."
732,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a dislocation?,"A dislocation occurs when the bones that meet at a joint move out of their normal position. This type of injury is usually caused by a violent force that tears the ligaments, allowing the bones to move out of place."
733,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a sprain?,"A sprain occurs when a ligament is stretched, torn, or damaged. Ligaments connect bones together at the joints. Sprains most commonly affect the ankle, knee, wrist, and finger joints."
734,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a muscle cramp?,"A muscle cramp is a painful condition that can be caused by heavy exercise or staying in the same position for too long. It can usually be relieved by stretching and massaging the affected area, resting, or changing position."
735,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,"What are the common causes of bone, muscle, and joint injuries?","The common causes of bone, muscle, and joint injuries include falls, awkward or sudden movements, direct blows to the body, and repetitive actions or forces."
736,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a strain?,"A strain occurs when a tendon or muscle is stretched, torn, or damaged. Tendons connect muscles to bones. Strains are often caused by overworking a muscle, such as lifting an overly heavy object or repetitively performing the same action."
737,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,121,What is a fracture?,"A fracture is a complete break, chip, or crack in a bone. Fractures can be open (if the end of the broken bone breaks through the skin) or closed (the broken bone does not break through the skin). Open fractures are also called 'compound fractures.'"
738,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,122,"What are some tips to prevent bone, muscle, and joint injuries?","Always wear seat belts and shoulder restraints when in a vehicle, secure younger children in approved and properly installed child-restraint systems, wear all safety equipment that is required or recommended, put non-slip adhesive strips or a mat in the bathtub and shower stall, stretch before exercising, and avoid over-exertion and take breaks often."
739,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,122,How can falls among the elderly be reduced?,"Good lighting, sturdy railings on staircases, and non-slip floors and rugs can help reduce the risk of falls among the elderly."

•It is not possible to safely or comfortably move the person to a vehicle for transport to a healthcare facility."
744,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,123,"Should you apply heat to a muscle, bone, or joint injury to speed healing?","No, applying heat is not the best treatment for an acute muscle, bone, or joint injury. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate, increasing swelling. Cold, on the other hand, causes blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow and helping to reduce swelling. Applying cold also slows nerve impulses and helps reduce pain."
745,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,123,What is the RICE method for treating an injury?,"The RICE method stands for:
- REST: Have the person stop any current activities and rest without moving or straightening the injured body part.
- ICE: If it does not cause discomfort, cool the injured area for 20 minutes of every hour to reduce swelling and pain. Do not rub the ice directly on the skin.
- COMPRESSION: Apply compression to the injured area using a bandage or wrap to help reduce swelling.
- ELEVATION: Keep the injured area above the level of the heart, if possible, to reduce swelling."
746,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,123,When should you apply a splint?,"You should apply a splint only if you must move a person to get medical help or if the EMS response will be delayed. Splinting involves securing an injured bone or joint to keep it from moving, which reduces the risk of further injury and helps reduce pain."
747,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,123,What can be used to improvise slings and splints?,"Common items such as rolled newspapers, scarves, belts, and pillows can be used to improvise slings and splints if commercial versions are not available. Medical tape and medical braces can also be used to support strains and sprains."
748,../data/guidelines/redcross_guidelines.pdf,124,What are the four types of splint?,"The four types of splint are anatomical splints, soft splints, rigid splints, and slings."
